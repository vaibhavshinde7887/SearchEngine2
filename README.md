# Search Engine Project
## Overview
This is a Java-based web application for a search engine that utilizes the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for efficient indexing and retrieval of information. The project is built using Maven for dependency management, and it integrates with a MySQL database for data storage.

## Technologies Used
 - Java: The core programming language for the web application.
 - Maven: Dependency management and project build tool.
 - MySQL: Relational database for storing and managing data.
 - Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm: Used for indexing and searching.

## Instructions for Running the Project

### Clone the Repository:
- git clone [https://github.com/Rishabhsati/Search-Engine.git](https://github.com/Rishabhsati/Search-Engine)
- cd Search-Engine
- open mysql and create database and create table pages and history and then 
- open web crawler folder and run that folder after that open search engine folder and run that folder

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the need for a simple search engine using Java and the DFS algorithm.
